# Dead / Unused Code Candidates (Phase 0)

## Scan criteria
- Files not modified in 30+ days **and**
- Zero imports/references (best-effort via ripgrep + git log).

## Results
No files met the criteria during the automated scan.

## Notes (abandoned boilerplate)
- No unused configs or duplicated helper modules identified beyond the items addressed in Phase 2 consolidation steps.
