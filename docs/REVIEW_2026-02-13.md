# Repository Review — 2026-02-13

## Scope
- Ran baseline automated checks.
- Reviewed top-level docs and test setup for consistency.
- Applied one low-risk quality fix in lint configuration.

## Checks Run
1. `npm run test -- --runInBand`
   - Result: **pass** (10/10 suites, 56/56 tests).
   - Note: several tests intentionally exercise error branches and emit console warnings/errors during successful assertions.

2. `npm run lint`
   - Result: **fail**.
   - Primary finding: repository has a large existing formatting/style backlog (hundreds of Prettier/quotes/inline-style findings).
   - Additional finding (fixed): generated artifact folders were not excluded from lint scope.

## Issues Identified

### 1) Lint backlog is high
- `eslint .` currently reports a very large number of findings, dominated by formatting issues.
- This makes it hard to isolate new regressions from legacy style debt.

**Recommendation**
- Run a staged formatting cleanup (for example per-directory) rather than a single monolithic rewrite.
- Add CI rule to lint only changed files until backlog is reduced.

### 2) Lint unnecessarily scanned generated outputs (fixed)
- Build/report directories should not be lint targets.
- These directories can introduce noise and increase lint time.

**Fix applied**
- Added `.eslintignore` entries for generated folders (`dist`, `coverage`, `playwright-report`, `test-results`, Android build directories).

### 3) Test output is noisy but stable
- Current tests pass, but expected error-path logging prints stack traces.
- This is not a functional failure, but it reduces signal during CI triage.

**Recommendation**
- Optionally mock/suppress console output in tests that validate failure paths.

## Documentation Check
- Existing top-level test/lint commands in `package.json` are accurate and runnable.
- No immediate doc-command mismatch found during this pass.

## Follow-up Candidate Tasks
- Apply `eslint --fix` to a targeted subset (`src/services` and `__tests__` first).
- Add a lightweight `lint:changed` script for incremental cleanup.
- Normalize quote style in test files to reduce recurring formatter failures.
