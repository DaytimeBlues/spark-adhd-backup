        "problem_statement": "ADHD management often suffers from high friction between activities like brainstorming, task creation, and symptom management. Spark-ADHD aims to eliminate this friction by integrating brainstorming with Google Tasks, providing a persistent 'bubble' interface for instant access to tools (brown noise, brain dumps, CBT, stress help), and leveraging Plaud integration for seamless voice-to-task automation.",
