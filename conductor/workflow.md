# Workflow Preferences - Spark-ADHD

## Development Methodology

- **TDD Strictness**: Strict. Tests are required before implementation to ensure system stability in a vibe-coding environment.

## Version Control

- **Commit Strategy**: Squash. One clean, descriptive commit per logical task to maintain a readable project history.

## Quality Assurance

- **Code Review Policy**: Flexible. The agent proceeds with implementation and commits to maintain momentum, while informing the user of all changes.
- **Verification Checkpoints**: Track Completion. Manual verification by the user is required once an entire feature track is completed.
