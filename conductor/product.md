# Product Definition - Spark-ADHD

## Project Name

Spark-ADHD

## Description

A one stop shop for all my ADHD concerns.

## Problem Statement

ADHD management often suffers from high friction between activities like brainstorming, task creation, and symptom management. Spark-ADHD aims to eliminate this friction by integrating brainstorming with Google Tasks, providing a persistent 'bubble' interface for instant access to tools (brown noise, brain dumps, CBT, stress help), and leveraging Plaud integration for seamless voice-to-task automation.

## Target Users

Primarily personal use (Steve) with the potential to serve the broader ADHD community looking for low-friction, persistent accessibility tools.

## Key Goals

- **Automated Workflow**: Seamless sync between brainstorm sessions/Plaud voice recordings and Google Tasks.
- **Instant Accessibility**: A persistent 'bubble' interface providing sub-second access to ADHD tools (brown noise, CBT, brain dump).
- **Frictionless Management**: Unified 'one stop shop' for addressing stress, brain fog, and task organization.
